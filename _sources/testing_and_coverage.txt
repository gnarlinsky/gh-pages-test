The script `cover.sh` (in the `mysite` directory, on the same level as
`manage.py`) runs the tests (see :mod:`app.tests`) and determines test
coverage, with detailed HTML results.

    $ ./cover.sh

    TestCase AdminTests

    TestCase HelpersTests
    test_helpers: 
            Test that valid email addresses are parsed from string.

    HTML results are in htmlcov/index.html


.. note::
    **Cover.sh** - The line ``open htmlcov/index.html`` opens the HTML
    coverage information with your system's default browser. Note this may only work
    in OS X, where the ``open`` command opens directories and files with the
    default application for the file's extension â€” so you might want to comment out
    that statement.
